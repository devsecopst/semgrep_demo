          Affected versions of org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core and org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-catalina
          are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data / Path Equivalence. This can lead to Remote Code

          Affected versions of org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core, org.apache.tomcat:tomcat- catalina,
          and org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-embed-core are vulnerable to Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race
          Condition. Apache Tomcat is susceptible to a TOCTOU race condition vulnerability. This occurs when
          running on a case insensitive file system with the default servlet write enabled, potentially
          allowing attackers to exploit misconfiguration or race conditions if the system property
          `sun.io.useCanonCaches` is not correctly set. Specific mitigations are necessary based on the Java
          version used, and failure to implement these could lead to unauthorized file writes or other
          security risks.

          configured header limits, the corresponding HTTP/2 stream remains unreset until after all headers
          have been processed.

          2.12.7.1 and 2.13.x before 2.13.4, enabling the `UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS` feature allows a
          specially crafted deeply nested array to exhaust system resources during deserialization. This can
          lead to application crashes or Denial of Service (DoS), as unvalidated input can exploit the lack of
          checks in the deserialization process.

          A secret is hard-coded in the application. Secrets stored in source code, such as credentials,
          identifiers, and other types of sensitive data, can be leaked and used by internal or external
          malicious actors. It is recommended to rotate the secret and retrieve them from a secure secret
          vault or Hardware Security Module (HSM), alternatively environment variables can be used if allowed
          by your company policy.
